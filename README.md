# KNN-Classification-and-Model-Evaluation
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification with Data Scaling and Accuracy Evaluation.


This repository contains the code and outputs for **Lab 7** of the Machine Learning course. The primary focus of this lab is on implementing the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm using the `scikit-learn` library and evaluating model performance using accuracy metrics.

---

## 📘 Lab Objective

- To understand and implement the **K-Nearest Neighbors** classification algorithm.
- To learn how to **preprocess data** using `StandardScaler`.
- To evaluate model performance using `train_test_split` and `accuracy_score`.
